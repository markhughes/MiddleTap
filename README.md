### Hide Status Bar Item

1. Holding `⌘`, drag it away from the status bar until you see a :heavy_multiplication_x: (cross icon)
2. Let it go

> To recover the item, just open MiddleTap when it's already running

### Number of Fingers
- Want to use 4, 5 or 2 fingers for middleclicking? No trouble. Even 10 is possible.

```sh
defaults write com.rouge41.middleClick fingers <int>
```
> Initially, it's 3 fingers to middleclick.

### Add Login Item

> Make it open automatically when you log in

<details>
  
<summary>Just add MiddleTap to your "Login Items". <p align="right">(it's handy to be done using command line)</p></summary>
  
```powershell
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to make login item at end with properties {path:"/Applications/MiddleClick.app", hidden:true}'
```

<details>
  <summary>This fork differs from the <a href="//github.com/cl3m/MiddleClick">base fork</a> in some ways</summary>

- Configurations: Number of Fingers, Click or Tap
  - preferred setting is saved for every user
- Removed old 32-bit/PowerPc `relaunch` binary due to it's incompatibility with macOS 10.15 Catalina and greater. Replaced with inline restarting of the app
- The App will not only restart on waking the Mac, but when a new touch device is added (so it immediately gains middleclicking ability) and when a display is added/reconfigured (for proper click positioning)
</details>

#### Attention! Make sure to:

1. Quit an old version of MiddleClick
2. Remove it from the privacy settings
3. Enable the new version in privacy settings when prompted

> The app should be closed when you change the privacy settings, otherwise the Mouse may not be clickable and you may have to `killall MiddleClick` via terminal or even force restart the Mac.
